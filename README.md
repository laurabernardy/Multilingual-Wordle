# WannabeWordle

An (I must admit: ugly, but working!) clone of the word guessing game [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) in german language (WannabeWordle == "MÃ¶chtegern Wordle"). It's a bloody beginner project, therefore it's written in python. Also there is an executable for win, mac and linux. An english or multilingual version and a web app is planned (yeah, i want to learn Typescript.).

# Get started

For using the little game you have to install PySimpleGUI with
```
pip install pysimplegui
```
If you choose the one without internal words list (for changing it etc.) make sure, that you put it in the same folder like the main py. 

# Rules

You have 6 rounds for guessing the word. Each round the game tells you with
green => That this letter is at the right place
yellow => The letter is in the word, but not at the right place
it stays grey => The letter is not in the word

Also the keyboard graphic tells you, which letters you used, which ones are right and which ones are false. 

easy! Have fun!

# Footnotes

Game was created by using [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) (Also the keyboard was inspired by the "cookbook")

Thanks to my favourite Nebelchen for inspiring me with his awesome excel work!
